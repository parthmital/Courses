# Notes Repo

This repo is just for **me**.

I use it to dump, organize, and keep track of notes for different subjects I’m learning.  
Nothing fancy. No audience. No polish.

## Why this exists

I don’t like writing notes by hand.  
I also don’t like sitting through full courses when I can learn the same stuff faster on my own.

So instead:

- I learn things **at my own pace**
- I use **my own sources** (docs, blogs, videos, random links, etc.)
- I write notes only when something is actually worth writing down

GitHub makes this easy:

- folders stay structured
- everything is searchable
- I can add images, links, diagrams, and whatever else I need
- version history comes for free
- I can reorganize stuff anytime without rewriting everything

## Organization

Everything is **heavily structured** on purpose.

The overall flow for each subject is usually based on a **Udemy course syllabus**, not because I follow the course, but because it’s a clean, ready-made outline of what topics exist and in what order.

I don’t necessarily watch the course.
I just steal the structure.

That gives me:

- clear topic boundaries
- no missed fundamentals
- flexibility to jump around when I want

## How I actually use this

- Learn from anywhere
- Open this repo
- Add notes where they belong
- Insert links, screenshots, diagrams, or references
- Move things around if my understanding changes

That’s it.

## Important

This repo is:

- not public-facing
- not optimized for others
- not a replacement for courses
- not meant to be perfect

It’s just a **personal knowledge base** that happens to live on GitHub.
